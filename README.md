## Introduction

This repository includes various Kubernetes configurations that I have developed and used throughout my career as a Senior Kubernetes Engineer. These examples aim to provide practical, real-world scenarios to help you get started with Kubernetes and improve your cluster management skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster up and running. You can use any Kubernetes provider such as Minikube, Kind, or a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean.

### Prerequisites

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- A running Kubernetes cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) (for some examples)

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/saieswarnookala/Kubernetes.git
cd Kubernetes
```

## Examples

### Deployments

Example YAML files for Kubernetes Deployments. Deployments manage the desired state of your application by creating and updating instances of your application.

- [Nginx Deployment](examples/deployments/nginx-deployment.yaml)
- [Node.js Deployment](examples/deployments/nodejs-deployment.yaml)

### Services

Example YAML files for Kubernetes Services. Services provide a stable network endpoint for accessing your applications.

- [ClusterIP Service](examples/services/clusterip-service.yaml)
- [NodePort Service](examples/services/nodeport-service.yaml)
- [LoadBalancer Service](examples/services/loadbalancer-service.yaml)

### Persistent Volumes

Example YAML files for Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims. These examples demonstrate how to configure storage for your applications.

- [Persistent Volume](examples/persistent-volumes/pv.yaml)
- [Persistent Volume Claim](examples/persistent-volumes/pvc.yaml)

### ConfigMaps and Secrets

Example YAML files for ConfigMaps and Secrets. These resources provide a way to manage configuration data and sensitive information.

- [ConfigMap](examples/configmaps/configmap.yaml)
- [Secret](examples/secrets/secret.yaml)

### StatefulSets

Example YAML files for StatefulSets. StatefulSets are used for stateful applications that require persistent storage and stable network identities.

- [StatefulSet](examples/statefulsets/statefulset.yaml)

### Ingress

Example YAML files for Ingress resources. Ingress manages external access to your services, typically HTTP.

- [Ingress](examples/ingress/ingress.yaml)

## Best Practices

- Follow the [Kubernetes Best Practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/)
- Use [Helm](https://helm.sh/) for managing complex Kubernetes applications
- Ensure proper security by using [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
